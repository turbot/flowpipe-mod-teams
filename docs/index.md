# Teams Mod for Flowpipe

A collection of [Flowpipe](https://flowpipe.io) pipelines that can be used to:
- Send messages
- Create teams
- Manage channels
- And more!

## Documentation

- **[Pipelines â†’](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/teams/pipelines)**

## Getting started

### Installation

Download and install Flowpipe (https://flowpipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install flowpipe
```

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/flowpipe-mod-teams.git
cd flowpipe-mod-teams
```

### Configuration

Configure your credentials:

```sh
cp flowpipe.fpvars.example flowpipe.fpvars
vi flowpipe.fpvars
```

It's recommended to configure credentials through [input variables](https://flowpipe.io/docs/using-flowpipe/mod-variables) by setting them in the `flowpipe.fpvars` file.

**Note:** Credentials can also be passed in each pipeline run with `--arg acces_token=YourAccessToken`.

Additional input variables may be defined in the mod's `variables.fp` file that can be configured to better match your environment and requirements.

Variables with defaults set do not need to be explicitly set, but it may be helpful to override them.

### Usage

Start the Flowpipe server to get started:

```sh
flowpipe service start
```

Run a pipeline:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run list_teams
```

## Passing pipeline arguments

To pass values into pipeline [parameters](https://flowpipe.io/docs/using-flowpipe/pipeline-parameters), use the following syntax:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run delete_team --arg team_id=0f8b3036-1111-4f5c-99a8-d2e36c34cf12
```

Multiple pipeline args can be passed in with separate `--arg` flags.

For more information on passing arguments, please see [Pipeline Args](https://flowpipe.io/docs/using-flowpipe/pipeline-arguments).
